# Simple Counter Simulation

The directory `src/` contains the outline for a counter module, and also some basic test cases in `counter_tb.sv`.  You need to do the following:

1. Create a project on edaplayground.com
2. Add the source and test bench there
3. Complete the source for the counter as well as the test bench
4. Run the simulation and demonstrate

## Grading

Total marks for project: 20

- Basic functionality (creating project) - 5
- Run simulation with existing test cases (add clock) - 10
- Add extra test cases - 5
